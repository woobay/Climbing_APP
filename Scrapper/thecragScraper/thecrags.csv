"Enjoyable little trad climb on an otherwise sport climbing dominant crag. Short but sweet, standard set of black diamond stopper nuts should do the job.",5.7, Lockin' 'r Hookin',Trad
"Climb the left facing corner crack through a shallow chimney to the first ledge and start of the corner offwidth crack. The crack is short but well worth the effort.
Climb the crack to the upper ledge. The chains can be found on the left facing wall about 1.5m above the upper ledge.
A few large CAMALOTS C4 #5- #7 will eliminate the run out in the upper wife section.",5.9, Drifter's Escape,Trad

A technical climb with a distinct crux on the bulge. Great grippy rock. Lots of edges and crimps! Was only 4bolts in 25m. Now it's is 8 and climbs modern and safely. Completely rebolted 2017 by Mason Tessier.,5.12a, Double Clutch,Sport
